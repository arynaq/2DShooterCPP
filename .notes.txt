#Events

    - Need a way to send information across the different systems when a component changes a value
    - This information should be sent to all concerned systems (eg InputSystem only listens for mesages that concern PlayerComponent)
    - Signals are one way of doing this...

    Eg a VelocityComponent has 

        template <typename T>
        struct VelocityComponent : Component {  
            
                ....
                signal <void(const T&)> 
        }
